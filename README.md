Allow js-git to clone from the browser by turning CORS response headers in a chrome extension

Clone this repo to your desktop, add as extension to chrome.

A new icon with default icon will appear.  When it's clicked it will enable CORS to all domains for that tab.

For example, go to http://clone-test.creationix.com/ after installing the plugin.

Once it's activated, you can clone over https using direct XHR.
