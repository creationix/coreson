corson
======

Allow [js-git](https://github.com/creationix/js-git) to clone from the browser by turning CORS response headers in a Google Chrome extension.

## Usage

Clone this repo to your desktop, add as extension to chrome.

A new icon with default icon will appear.  When it's clicked it will enable CORS to all domains for that tab.

Once it's activated, you can clone over https using direct XHR.

For example, go to http://creationix.github.io/clone-test/ after installing the extension.
